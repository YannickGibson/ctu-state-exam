# ctu-state-exams

Self-hostable study webapp for Czech Technical University (ČVUT) state exam questions. Browse the question list, read tightly-cropped answers extracted from lecture PDFs (with deep links back to the source page for verification), and run subject-level quizzes.

**Currently bundled content**: NI (FIT) AI master's program 2026 — 20 shared (SPOL) questions + 22 Znalostní Inženýrství (ZI) specialization questions. The engine is content-pack-driven, so other CTU programs (or even non-CTU exams) can be added by replacing the markdown files under `data/answers/` and the question lists in `SPOL.md` / `ZI.md`.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + React, KaTeX for LaTeX rendering
- **Backend**: Express (locally) / Vercel serverless function (in production) — serves the question/answer/quiz APIs and the static PDFs
- **Auth + sync**: Supabase (username/password, per-user progress, optional leaderboard)
- **Deployment target**: Vercel Hobby tier

## Local development

The lecture PDFs under `sources/` live in a separate **private** submodule (because they're copyrighted by their instructors and can't be redistributed via this public repo). If you have access, clone with submodules; otherwise the app still runs — the `/pdfs/...` deep links from answers will just 404.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YannickGibson/ctu-state-exams.git
# or, in an existing clone: git submodule update --init
npm run setup     # installs root + client deps, generates data/questions.json
cp client/.env.local.example client/.env.local
# fill in VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY — see docs/supabase-setup.md
npm run dev       # API on :3001, Vite on :5173 with HMR
```

For a production-mode local build (Express also serves the built frontend at :3001):

```sh
npm start
```

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Set up a Supabase project — see [`docs/supabase-setup.md`](./docs/supabase-setup.md).
2. Push this repo to GitHub and import it on https://vercel.com.
3. In Vercel **Project Settings → Environment Variables**, add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (Production + Preview).
4. Deploy. The bundled `vercel.json` wires the Express app as a serverless function (`/api/*`) and serves the SPA + PDFs + answer screenshots as static assets.

In your Supabase project, go to **Authentication → URL Configuration** and add your Vercel domain to the allowlist.

## How it works

- `npm run generate` rebuilds `data/questions.json` from `SPOL.md` and `ZI.md` and creates any missing answer/quiz stub files. It never overwrites existing content.
- Pages: `/questions` (list with progress), `/questions/:id` (single question with answer + screenshots), `/quizzes` and `/quizzes/:subject` (multiple-choice quiz per subject), `/leaderboard` (opt-in).
- Per-question answers in `data/answers/<id>.md` are short Markdown documents that link out to cropped screenshots (`data/answers/imgs/<id>/…`) and deep-link into the merged lecture PDFs (`sources/.../X_Merged.pdf#page=N`).

## Editing or replacing content

Everything is plain files you can edit by hand or with AI:

- `SPOL.md`, `ZI.md` — the canonical question lists. Markdown tables; the columns are parsed by `scripts/generate-data.js`.
- `data/answers/<id>.md` — one Markdown file per question. Supports LaTeX (`$…$`, `$$…$$`). Keep answers dense and short.
- `data/answers/imgs/<id>/` — cropped screenshots referenced from the markdown.
- `data/quizzes/<subject>.json` — one quiz per subject. Each question has `prompt`, `choices`, `correctIndex`, `explanation`.
- `sources/` — merged lecture PDFs the answers cite. Forkers should drop in their own.

After editing question lists, run `npm run generate` to refresh `data/questions.json`.

## Progress rules

- `practicedCount` increments each time a question is practiced (unbounded). Finishing a subject's quiz increments it for every question of that subject.
- `readPassively` may be `true` only while `practicedCount` is `0`.
- In the list, the practiced badge shows its label only at count ≥ 2.

## Content licensing note

The code is MIT-licensed (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)). The lecture PDFs the deployed app serves at `/pdfs/...` belong to their respective CTU instructors and are **not** redistributed by this public repo — they live in a private submodule at `sources/` that the Vercel build clones during deploy. If you fork this for a different program, point the submodule at your own private content repo (or remove the submodule and supply PDFs locally) and make sure you have the right to use whatever you bundle.
